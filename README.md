Photogalaxy-Gencat
==================

Tools necessary to generate a noisely photometryc galaxy mock catalog. The input must be a list of galaxies with their m, z, t, where m is the true magnitude in some band, z is the true redshift and t is the spectral type. The ouput is used in a photometric redshift code such as BPZ, lephare, ANNz, etc.
